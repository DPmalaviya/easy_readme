# LeetCode_Practice

**A curated collection of LeetCode solutions in Python.**

This repository serves as a personal record of my LeetCode problem-solving journey.  It's designed to be both a learning resource for myself and potentially a helpful reference for others interested in improving their algorithmic thinking and coding skills using Python.

## Project Goals

* **Consistent Practice:**  Document my progress and maintain a consistent practice rhythm.
* **Skill Improvement:** Hone my problem-solving skills in data structures and algorithms.
* **Code Quality:**  Write clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.
* **Community Contribution:** Share solutions and potentially contribute to discussions on specific problems.

## Structure

The repository is organized by LeetCode problem number. Each problem has its own folder containing:

* **`solution.py`**: The Python code for my solution to the problem.
* **`README.md`**: (Optional)  A detailed explanation of my approach, time/space complexity analysis, and any alternative solutions considered.  This also includes links to the original LeetCode problem description.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/LeetCode_Practice.git
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

**To run a solution:**

1. Navigate to the problem's directory (e.g., `./1-two-sum`).
2. Run the `solution.py` file using a Python interpreter: `python solution.py`

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal learning, contributions are welcome.  If you find any errors, have a more efficient solution, or want to add explanations to existing solutions, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure your code follows the style guidelines below.


## Code Style

The code in this repository adheres to the PEP 8 style guide for Python.  Consistency and readability are prioritized.

## Problem Categories (To be populated)

This section will be updated as I solve more problems.  I plan to categorize problems based on common themes, such as:

* Arrays
* Strings
* Linked Lists
* Trees
* Graphs
* Dynamic Programming
* Sorting and Searching
* ...

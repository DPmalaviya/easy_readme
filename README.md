# LeetCode_Practice

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey through solving LeetCode problems, focusing on improving my problem-solving skills and strengthening my understanding of data structures and algorithms.  I'll be using Python as my primary language, and this repository will serve as a living record of my progress, including solutions, explanations, and performance analyses.

## Introduction

This repository houses my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem's solution will be organized into its own folder, containing:

* **Python script:**  The implemented solution in Python.
* **README.md:** A detailed explanation of the approach taken, including time and space complexity analysis, alternative solutions considered, and any insights gained during the problem-solving process.  This README will also include relevant diagrams where applicable to better illustrate concepts.
* **(Optional) Tests:** Unit tests verifying the correctness of the solution.


## Project Goals

* **Improve problem-solving skills:** Consistently practice breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
* **Master data structures and algorithms:**  Reinforce my understanding of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables, along with algorithms such as searching, sorting, dynamic programming, and graph traversal.
* **Enhance coding efficiency:** Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
* **Track progress:** Monitor my learning curve and identify areas for improvement.
* **Build a portfolio:** Showcase my problem-solving abilities to potential employers or collaborators.


## Technologies Used

* **Primary Language:** Python 3.x
* **Testing Framework (Optional):**  pytest (or unittest)


## Directory Structure

The repository will follow a structured directory organization for better management of solutions.  Each problem will be organized in a dedicated subfolder within the `problems` directory, following the LeetCode problem number. For example:

```
LeetCode_Practice/
├── problems/
│   ├── 1-two-sum/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── 2-add-two-numbers/
│       ├── solution.py
│       └── README.md
└── ...
```

## Contributing (Optional)

While this is primarily a personal repository for my learning journey, contributions are welcome if you identify inaccuracies, have suggestions for improvements in the solutions, or want to add alternative approaches. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.  Ensure your contributions align with the project's goals and coding style.

**Note:** Remember to actually create the `problems` directory and add a `LICENSE` file with the MIT License text. You can easily find a MIT License template online.  You'll also need to populate the `problems` directory with your LeetCode solutions as you progress.  This README provides a solid foundation for a well-organized and informative repository.

# LeetCode_Practice

**Conquer LeetCode, One Problem at a Time!**

This repository serves as my personal journey through the world of LeetCode.  Here, you'll find my solutions to various problems, categorized by topic and difficulty.  It's a work in progress, constantly evolving as I tackle new challenges and refine my problem-solving skills. Feel free to browse, learn, and contribute (if you find any improvements or have alternative solutions!).

## About

This repository is designed to document my progress in mastering algorithms and data structures through LeetCode practice.  Each problem solution includes:

* **Problem Statement:** A concise summary of the problem.
* **Solution:** My implemented solution in Python.  I strive for clarity, efficiency, and optimal time/space complexity.
* **Explanation:** A detailed breakdown of my approach, including the algorithm used, data structures employed, and any edge cases considered.
* **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**  A formal analysis of the solution's performance characteristics.

The goal is to not only solve the problems, but also to learn from them, improving my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts along the way.


## Problem Categories

I've organized the solutions into the following categories based on their focus:

* **Arrays & Strings:** Problems involving array manipulation, string processing, and related algorithms.
* **Linked Lists:** Solutions for problems dealing with linked list structures and operations.
* **Trees & Graphs:** Problems focused on tree traversals, graph algorithms (BFS, DFS), and related techniques.
* **Dynamic Programming:** Solutions leveraging dynamic programming principles for optimization.
* **Sorting & Searching:** Problems involving sorting algorithms (merge sort, quick sort, etc.) and search techniques (binary search, etc.).
* **Two Pointers:**  Problems effectively solved using the two-pointer technique.
* **Math:**  Problems with a significant mathematical component.
* **Backtracking:** Problems that benefit from backtracking algorithms.
* **Greedy Algorithms:** Problems solved using greedy approaches.


**(This list will expand as I progress through LeetCode.)**


## Contribution Guidelines

While this is primarily for my personal learning, contributions are welcome!  If you find a more efficient solution, a cleaner implementation, or a bug in my code, please feel free to submit a pull request.  Please ensure your contribution adheres to the following guidelines:

* **Code Style:** Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
* **Clear Documentation:**  Provide clear and concise comments and explanations for your code.
* **Testing:**  Include unit tests to verify the correctness of your solution.

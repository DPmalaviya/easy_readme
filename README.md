## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of resources to help you learn about application security. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find valuable materials here to enhance your knowledge and skills in securing applications. The resources are categorized for easy navigation and cover a wide range of topics, including OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and various security testing methodologies.


## Installation Guide

This repository doesn't require installation in the traditional sense.  It's a curated list, so you simply need to clone the repository to your local machine to access the resources:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/awesome-appsec.git
```

Then navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd awesome-appsec
```

You can then browse the resources directly in the `resources` directory (or however you organize your resources).  Some resources may require further installation or setup, as indicated in their respective descriptions.


## Usage Instructions

The resources are organized into categories (you'll need to create these categories within the repository).  You can browse the categories and select resources relevant to your learning goals.  Each resource entry should include a brief description, a link to the resource, and any relevant notes.

For example, a category might be "OWASP Top 10," containing links to articles, tutorials, and tools related to each of the top 10 vulnerabilities.  Another category might be "Secure Coding Practices," with resources on topics like input validation, authentication, and authorization.
